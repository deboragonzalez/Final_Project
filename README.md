# The Sunshine State Turns Purple on Election Day
### Final Project for Data Visualization at Harvard University
#### Created By: Debora Gonzalez


This project explores Florida's political allegiance changes from 1972 to the present and highlights selected demographic trends that may relate to party affiliation in the Sunshine State.

The maps and graphics in this app do not account for independent or third-party registered voters when determining the "allegiance" of counties. The allegiance and/or color of each county are determined based on the party with the greater raw number of registered voters respectively. It is not representative of independent registered voters or their allegiance. As a result, counties can turn red or blue on Election Day regardless of their allegiance on this map.

Florida, as a southern state, has an inherent Democratic bias. This bias stems from the historical context of the state. In the pre-FDR era, most southern states were majority Democratic. The party ideology switch left many previously registered democratic voters voting Republican on election day. Over time, this influence, or bias, has diminished, but can still be observed in the graphics showing voter registration trends over time. In addition, the increasing number of independent registered voters denoted in the Allegiance Over Time section of this app are significant in explaining the "purple" nature of Florida's political arena. These registered voters are actively participating in political decisions, but do not label themselves with a political affiliation, which makes them "volatile" and very much necessary to win the state.
